How to install Insight on windows:

1) Download cygwin
2) 
	To compile and install the EDA tools from source, you will need the following packages:
		autoconf at Devel/autoconf
		gcc at Devel/gcc
		libtool at Devel/libtool
		make at Devel/make
		M4 at Interpreters/m4
		X11 development at X11/xorg-x11-devel
		tcsh at Shells/tcsh (necessary only for compiling magic)
		
	The following packages are optional but will make life easier if anything goes wrong:
		
		gdb at Devel/gdb
		emacs at Editors/emacs or
		vim at Editors/vim
		
	The following packages are not needed by the EDA tools but are a good idea to include anyway:
		
		zip at Archive/zip
		unzip at Archive/unzip
		automake at Devel/automake
		g++ at Devel/g++
	
3) Go to C:\Cygwin (typical folder) throught cygwin batch.
4) Copy tcltk tgz files to root directory
5) Type: tar xfz tcltk_x11_win.tgz
6) Type: tar xfz tcltk_x11_vista.tgz
7) delete tgz files.
